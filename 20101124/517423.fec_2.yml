    (9/1/2010 ? 9/30/2010)    1.  The transfers from ?Jim Himes for Congress? and
    ?Larson for Congress? were transfers from the candidate?s committee?s to the State
    Party.  All transfers for this report from these committees have been corrected
    to disclose on Line 11 (c).    2.  The payment on Line 21 (b) disclosing a payment
    for ?On-line Voter Access? is the federal share of an in-kind received by the
    committee.  The compliance software automatically discloses the in-kind onto Line
    21 (b).    3.  The disbursements on Schedule B for Catering (Fundraising) and
    Printing (Fundraising) were made in association with a committee fundraiser and
    no expenditures were made on behalf of a specifically identified federal candidate.
    \ The disbursement for Food and Beverage on Schedule H4 was for the water in the
    water cooler that is located in our Hartford office.    4. The committee understands
    the restrictions on distribution that must be met so that payments for campaign
    materials are exempt from the definition of contribution or expenditure.  Campaign
    materials such as mail must be distributed by volunteers, and no public advertising
    may be used, including no direct mail by commercial vendors or using commercial
    lists.    \tThe committee also understands that such activities must be paid with
    funds permitted under the Act; that none of the funds may have been designated
    for a particular candidate; and that no funds transferred-in from a national committee
    that is designated for an exempt activity may be used for these exempt activities.
    \ The committee had raised enough funds from individuals and political committees
    to pay for the exempt activity.  The committee did not accept contributions designated
    for any particular candidate.  Furthermore, the committee did not accept any transfers
    from the national party committee designated for any exempt activity.    5.  The
    Schedule H4 disclosing payments for ?Travel per diem? is neither a petty cash
    disbursement nor a reimbursement to an individual.  The expenditures are payments
    made based on our regular per diem policy which pays employees for their travel
    based on a pre-determined per diem rate in lieu of reimbursements.    Please advise
    if additional information is required.  \n"
