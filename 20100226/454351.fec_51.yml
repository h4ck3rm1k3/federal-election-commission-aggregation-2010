    value: 'Regarding ''Asset Sales'' reported on Schedule A supporting Line 15 of
      our report, occasionally the RNC has used office equipment that we need to dispose
      of.  This equipment may be sold in bulk to a commercial liquidation business
      or piece by piece to individuals.  When this is done, these items are reported
      as ''asset sale'' and the price charged is such that they in no way constitute
      a political contribution.  The used assets liquidated by sale to individuals
      or business are reported as ''Asset Sale'' and are priced at fair market value.  These
      items sold by the RNC are not unique to our business, they are common items
      found in most business, such as computers and cell phones.  As such, the market
      price for these items are determined by referring to internet auction sites
      or checking replacement values from retail sources.
